# Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. 
# The numbers can be negative or non-integer. 
# If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

# Examples
# Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
# Output: 9.2

# Input: []
# Output: 0

# Input: [-2.398]
# Output: -2.398

# Assumptions
# You can assume that you are only given numbers.
# You cannot assume the size of the array.
# You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.

    total = 0
