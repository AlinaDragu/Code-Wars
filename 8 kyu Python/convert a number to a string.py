# We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

# What ways of achieving this do you know?

# Examples (input --> output):
# 123  --> "123"
# 999  --> "999"
# -100 --> "-100"

def number_to_string(num):
     # Return a string of the number here!
    return str(num)

print(repr(number_to_string(34))) #returns a string representation of an object that looks like you'd type it in code
