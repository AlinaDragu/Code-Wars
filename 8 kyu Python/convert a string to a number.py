# We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

# Examples
# "1234" --> 1234
# "605"  --> 605
# "1405" --> 1405
# "-7" --> -7

def string_to_number(s):
    # your code here
    return int(s)

print(string_to_number('1234'))
print(string_to_number('-2'))
