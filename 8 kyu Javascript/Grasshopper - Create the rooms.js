// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).


// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    room1: {
      name: "Room 1",
      description: "You are in a dimly lit room. There is a door to the north.",
      completed: false
    },
    room2: {
      name: "Room 2",
      description: "You entered a room filled with puzzles and mysterious artifacts.",
      completed: false
    },
    room3: {
      name: "Room 3",
      description: "This room is filled with mirrors. You can see your reflection everywhere.",
      completed: false
    }
  }
